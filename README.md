#Project_Details : 

This is my first project in react Eco System. In this project i tried to make functionallity like Facebook.Authentication, Log in, log out Handling with useState hook. Then i tried to show a blog page where user can create his/her blog,then can publish. 

in this project i focused on functionallity without any third party support & design was not my priority in this project that is why i did'nt use any css.

Main focuses on:
1) Component tree

2)understand react state from core,how one way data flow works,how props works.

3)react hooks (useState,useEffect)

4)Used React-Router-Dom for Routing.

Challenges i faced in this project:

This is my first project with React so This project was full of challenge for me. first of all i faced difficulties with managing state, then i understand why redux or context api need. managing one way data flowing was first challenge. then i struggled with conditional routing. if user is log in, only then in blogpage i can create or delete data & at last i learned how local storage work in react app. i struggled with useEffect hooks.then learn how useEffect hooks work. 



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
